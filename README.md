# Image Classifier

**Image Classifier** is a machine learning project that uses deep learning techniques to classify images into various categories. The model is built using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, a powerful architecture for image classification tasks. This project aims to predict the category of an image, such as distinguishing between different animals, objects, or scenes.

## Features

- **Image Classification**: Classify images into predefined categories.
- **Model Training**: Train a CNN model using labeled image datasets.
- **Data Augmentation**: Enhance the training dataset by augmenting images with transformations like rotation, flipping, and scaling.
- **Real-time Prediction**: Classify new images in real time using the trained model.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the model using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

## Installation
